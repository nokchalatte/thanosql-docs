# __Wav2Vec2__

__Notation Conventions__

- Parentheses `()` indicate ^^literal^^ parentheses.
- Braces `{}` are used to bind combinations of options.
- The bracket `[]` indicates an optional clause.
- An ellipsis following a comma in brackets [,...] means that the preceding item can be repeated as a comma-separated list
- The vertical bar `|` represents the logic `OR`.
- VALUE represents a regular value.

!!! note ""
    __literal__ : A fixed or unchangeable value, also known as a Constant.
    > Each literal has a special data type such as column, in the table.


## __BUILD MODEL Query Syntax__

Use the "__BUILD MODEL__" query to develop an AI model.
The "__BUILD MODEL__" statement allows you to train datasets defined with the query_expr that comes after the "__AS__" clause.

```sql
query_statement:
    query_expr

BUILD MODEL (model_name_expression)
USING { Wav2Vec2Ko | Wav2Vec2En }
OPTIONS (
    expression [ , ...]
    )
AS
(query_expr)
```

__OPTIONS Clause__

```sql
OPTIONS(
    (audio_col = column_name),
    (text_col = column_name),
    [batch_size = VALUE],
    [epochs = VALUE],
    [learning_rate = VALUE],
    [overwrite = {True | False}]
    )
```

The "__OPTIONS__" clause allows you to change the value of a parameter in the model. The definition of each parameter is as follows.

- "audio_col" : Sets the name of the column containing the audio path. (DEFAULT: "audio_path")
- "text_col" : Sets the name of the column containing the audio script. (DEFAULT : "text")
- "batch_size" : The size of the dataset bundle read during one train. (DEFAULT : 16)
- "epochs" : Sets how many times the dataset is trained in total. (DEFAULT : 5)
- "learning_rate" : The learning rate of the model. (DEFAULT : 0.0001)
- "overwrite" : Overwrite if a model with the same name exists. If True, the existing model is overwritten with the new model (DEFAULT: False)

__BUILD MODEL Query Example__

An example can be found in [Create Speech Recognition Model](/en/tutorials/thanosql_ml/audio_recognition/speech_recognition/).

```sql
%%thanosql
BUILD MODEL my_speech_recognition_model
USING Wav2Vec2En
OPTIONS (
  audio_col='audio_path',
  text_col='text',
  epochs=1,
  batch_size=4 ,
  overwrite=True
  )
AS
SELECT *
FROM librispeech_train
```

## __FIT MODEL Query Syntax__

The "__FIT MODEL__" query statement lets you re-train artificial intelligence models. The "__FIT MODEL__" expression allows you to re-train datasets defined with the query_expr that comes after the "__AS__" clause.

```sql
query_statement:
    query_expr

FIT MODEL (model_name_expression)
USING (model_name_expression)
OPTIONS (
    expression [ , ...]
    )
AS
(query_expr)
```

__OPTIONS ì ˆ__

```sql
OPTIONS(
    (audio_col = column_name),
    (text_col = column_name),
    [batch_size = VALUE],
    [epochs = VALUE],
    [learning_rate = VALUE],
    [overwrite = {True | False}]
    )
```

The "__OPTIONS__" clause allows you to change the value of a parameter in the model. The definition of each parameter is as follows.

- "audio_col" : Sets the name of the column containing the audio path. (DEFAULT: "audio_path")
- "text_col" : Sets the name of the column containing the audio script. (DEFAULT : "text")
- "batch_size" : The size of the dataset bundle read during one train. (DEFAULT : 16)
- "epochs" : Sets how many times the dataset is trained in total. (DEFAULT : 5)
- "learning_rate" : The learning rate of the model. (DEFAULT : 0.0001)
- "overwrite" : Overwrite if a model with the same name exists. If True, the existing model is overwritten with the new model (DEFAULT: False)


## __PREDICT USING Query Syntax__

Use this "__PREDICT USING__" query syntax to apply artificial intelligence models to test datasets to perform prediction, classification, recommendation, and more. The "__PREDICT USING__" expression can preprocess the dataset defined by query_expr after "__AS__".

```sql
query_statement:
    query_expr

PREDICT USING (model_name_expression)
OPTIONS (
    expression [ , ...]
    )
AS
(query_expr)
```

__OPTIONS Clause__

```sql
OPTIONS(
    (audio_col = column_name),
    [batch_size = VALUE]
    )
```

The "__OPTIONS__" clause allows you to change the value of a parameter in the model. The definition of each parameter is as follows.

- "audio_col" : Sets the name of the column containing the audio path. (DEFAULT: "audio_path")
- "batch_size" : The size of the dataset bundle read during one train. (DEFAULT : 16)

__PREDICT USING Query Example__

An example can be found in [Create Speech Recognition Model](/en/tutorials/thanosql_ml/audio_recognition/speech_recognition/).

```sql
%%thanosql
PREDICT USING my_speech_recognition_model
OPTIONS (
  audio_col='audio_path'
  )
AS
SELECT *
FROM librispeech_test
```

## __EVALUATE USING Query Syntax__

You can use the "__EVALUATE USING__" query statement to perform evaluation on the AI model. The "__EVALUATE USING__" expression evaluates the dataset defined by the query_expr that comes after the "__AS__" clause.

```sql
query_statement:
    query_expr

EVALUATE USING (model_name_expression)
OPTIONS (
    expression [ , ...]
    )
AS
(query_expr)
```

__OPTIONS Clause__

```sql
OPTIONS(
    (audio_col = column_name),
    (text_col = column_name),
    [batch_size = VALUE]
    )
```

The "__OPTIONS__" clause allows you to change the value of a parameter in the model. The definition of each parameter is as follows.

- "audio_col" : Sets the name of the column containing the audio path. (DEFAULT: "audio_path")
- "text_col" : Sets the name of the column containing the audio script. (DEFAULT : "text")
- "batch_size" : The size of the dataset bundle read during one train. (DEFAULT : 16)
